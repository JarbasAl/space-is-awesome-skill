Millions of meteoroids travel through Earth’s atmosphere each day.
When a meteor encounters our atmosphere and is vaporized, it leaves behind a trail. That “burning” meteoroid is called a meteor.
The appearance of a number of meteors occurring in the same part of the sky over a period of time is called “meteor shower”.
Over the course of Earth’s history, many meteorites (large and small) have fallen to our planet’s surface. The most famous are the Allende, the Fukang, Hoba, and the Willamette Meteorite.
Many meteor showers are associated with comets, which leave behind debris as they orbit through the solar system.  Showers occur when Earth’s orbit crosses the path of a comet’s orbit.
Most meteorites are one of three types: stony, stony-iron, or iron. These compositions tell us where the meteoroid existed in its parent body.  An iron or stony iron was close to the core of an asteroid, while a stony object was closer to the surface.
