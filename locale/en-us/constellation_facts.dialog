The official definition of a constellation is an area of the sky with defined boundaries, all stars and any other objects within that boundary are considered part of the constellation.
Historically and in common language stars that form patterns in the night sky are also referred to as constellations.
In modern scientific language stars that form patterns are known as asterisms, asterisms usually fall within a single constellation and bare the same name but they can also be part of multiple constellations.
There are 88 official constellations which are recognized by the International Astronomical Union.
Some constellations are only visible in the northern hemisphere, while others are only visible in the southern hemisphere.
Constellations that are visible in both hemispheres may appear upside down in the southern hemisphere.
A few constellations can be viewed all year long but most are seasonal and can only be viewed at certain times of the year.
Distant galaxies and nebulae also form parts of constellations.
The sun is the only known star in our galaxy which is not part of a constellation.
