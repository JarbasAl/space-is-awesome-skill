Supernova remnants are formed when large stars come to the end of their lifespan.
When large stars become unstable a violent explosion rips them apart scattering matter in all directions at incredible speeds.
The energy created by a supernova is enormous, causing it to briefly outshine its own galaxy.
The material ejected by a supernova will eventually form into a nebula.
