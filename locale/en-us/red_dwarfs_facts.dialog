Red Dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in our galaxy.
Red Dwarfs have less than 50% the mass of our own Sun, as a result they are much cooler and emit far less energy.
As Red Dwarfs burn their fuel at a very slow rate their lifespan is much longer than those of other stars, it is possible some could exist for over a trillion years.
Some red dwarfs with a high enough mass may become giants but will never achieve core temperatures high enough to begin fusing helium.
Red dwarfs are classified with the letter M.
