Pulsar planets orbit around Pulsars or Neutron Stars. These super dense, rapidly spinning stars are the core remains of a large star after a supernova explosion.
It is highly unlikely that any orbiting planet could survive the blast from a supernova so Pulsar Planets probably formed after the event and now orbit around the dead star.
