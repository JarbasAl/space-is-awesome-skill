As the name suggests reflection nebulas do not emit their own light, they reflect light from a nearby star.
The energy emitted by the nearby star or stars is not sufficient to ionize the surrounding gas of reflection nebulas, so we donâ€™t get the range of colors emitted by other nebulae.
light is reflected off the dust in the nebula so it is similar to the visible light given off by stars.
