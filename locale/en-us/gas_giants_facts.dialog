Gas giants are planets similar to Jupiter and Saturn.
Their mass is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium with possibly a dense rocky or metallic core.
The gas and ice giant planets take longer to orbit the Sun because of their great distances. The farther away they are, the more time it takes to make one trip around the Sun.
The densities of the gas giants are much less than the densities of the rocky, terrestrial worlds of the solar system.
Gas giants are not all gas. Beneath the heavy atmospheres of these Jupiter and Saturn are layers of molecular hydrogen and liquid metallic hydrogen.
Uranus has an icy layer over its solid rock core, and covered with a gaseous atmosphere. Neptune has a water-ammonia ocean for a mantle overlying its rocky core.
The metallic hydrogen layers in Jupiter and Saturn conduct electricity.
The cores of the gas giants are crushed under tremendously high pressures and they are very hot (up to 20,000 K), while the cores of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune are at 5000K and 5,400K respectively.
Gas giants have been found around more than a thousand stars by the Kepler mission. These large exoplanets are often referred to by such names as Hot Jupiters, SuperJupiters, and Giant Neptunes.
