Super Earths are ‘potentially’ rocky planets with up to 10 times the mass of Earth.
The term ‘Super Earth’ simply refers to the mass of the planet and not to any planetary conditions, so some of these may actually be gas dwarfs.
The first two exoplanets to be detected were Super Earths orbiting around the pulsar PSR B1257+12.
