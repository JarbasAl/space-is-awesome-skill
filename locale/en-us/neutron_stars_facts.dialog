After a Supernova the core of the star is left intact, what happens to the core all depends on how massive it is.
A core remnant with a mass of between 1.4 and 5 times larger than the Sun will form into a neutron star.
As the core collapses it combines electrons with protons to form neutrons allowing gravity to force the core to become even smaller.
Some neutron stars can be as small as 10 miles (16 km) in diameter and are incredibly dense
one teaspoonful of a neutron star would weigh hundreds of millions of tonnes.
