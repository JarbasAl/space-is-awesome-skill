Chthonian Planets were once gas giants but have migrated far too close to their parent star.
Their atmospheres have been roasted away, leaving only a rocky or metallic core.
It is possible their surface may be covered in molten lava.
Due to their similarity to terrestrial planets some Super Earths may actually be Chthonian Planets.
