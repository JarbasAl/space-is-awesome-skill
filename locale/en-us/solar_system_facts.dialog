The solar system is around 4.6 billion years old.
At the center of the solar system is the sun, a yellow dwarf star which produces vast amounts of energy.
There are eight major planets and over 100 moons in the solar system.
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are the small rocky planets. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are the gas giants.
All the planets orbit the sun in an elliptical, oval shaped path.
Many of the planets in the solar system are visible to the naked eye.
Other objects in the solar system include dwarf planets, asteroids and comets.
The solar system is in a galaxy known as "The Milky Way".
It is estimated that at least a third of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way are orbited by one or more planets.
The Voyager 1 spacecraft is the furthest man-made object in the solar system, it is around 12.5 billion miles (20 billion km) from the sun and is still sending data back to Earth.
