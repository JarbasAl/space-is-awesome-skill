Their surface temperatures can be almost twice as high as the sun and they are usually classified as A type stars.
Blue stars generally have a mass of more than twice that of the sun, in some cases they can have a mass of more than a hundred times that of the sun with surface temperatures up to 10 times hotter and thousands of times brighter.
Blue stars burn through their fuel at a far quicker rate than smaller stars meaning they have a lifespan of only a few million years, they are generally classified as B or O type stars.
