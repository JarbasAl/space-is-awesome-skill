Another type of Neutron Star is a Magnetar. These stars possess a magnetic field which is one thousand times stronger than a normal Neutron Star’s and one thousand trillion times stronger than Earth’s.
The magnetic field of a magnetar is so strong it heats up the stars surface to 10 million C, the temperature on the surface of the sun is only 5,500 C.
