Exoplanets also known as extrasolar planets, are planets which exist outside our solar system.
As of 2018, there have been 3,578 confirmed discoveries of exoplanets.
In 1992 two planets orbiting a distant pulsar became the first exoplanets to be detected.
In 1995 51 Pegasi B was the first exoplanet to be discovered orbiting a sun like star.
Since 2009 NASA's Kepler Misson has detected almost 7,000 possible or confirmed planets using its space based telescope.
The habitable zone is an area around a star which is at just the right temperature to allow liquid water to exist on a planet's surface.
Several possible Earth like planets have been detected orbiting in the habitable zone of stars.
Two small Earth sized planets have been detected in our nearest stellar neighbor Alpha Centauri, it is possible that one of them may be habitable.
Only two exoplanets have ever been directly observed using Earth based telescopes.
Around two thirds of the planets that have been discovered outside our solar system are either gas or ice giants.
