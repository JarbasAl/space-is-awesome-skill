Most meteor showers are caused by debris from comets. When Earth moves through those debris trails, we see increased numbers of comets.
Two meteor showers are caused by debris shed by asteroids. The Quadrantids are very likely caused by debris from the minor planet 2003 EH1. The Geminid meteor shower comes from debris shed by asteroid 3200 Phaethon.
The Orionid Meteor shower (which occurs in late October each year) is created by dust and debris left behind by the passage of Comet 1P/Halley.
Meteors fall to Earth during the day, although we can’t see them.
It is very rare that a meteorite will strike a human being. It’s more likely that it will fall into the ocean.
The best time to view a meteor shower is in the early morning hours, preferably on a dark, moonless night.
The earliest record of the Perseids meteor shower is found in Chinese annals from 36 AD.
