Planetary nebulae are formed when stars similar to the size of the Sun use up the hydrogen in their core and instead begin fusing hydrogen in an outer shell surrounding the core. This results in them expanding to hundreds of times their original size and becoming red giants. Eventually the core heats up enough to begin fusing helium, when the helium runs out the star becomes unstable and its outer layers are ejected leaving only the core remaining in the form of a white dwarf.
The radiation emitted by the white dwarf in Planetary nebulae ionizes the surrounding gas, producing spectacular color displays.
