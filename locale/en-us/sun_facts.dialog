The sun is a star at the center of our solar system and is thought to be around 4.5 billion years old.
It has a diameter of around 865,000 miles (1.4 million km), which is 109 times larger than Earth.
The mass of the sun accounts for 99.86% of all the mass in the solar system.
Three quarters of the sun is composed of hydrogen with helium making up most of the rest.
The sun is actually bigger and brighter than the vast majority of stars in our galaxy.
Charged particles that stream from the sun's upper atmosphere create a solar wind.
Sunspots are cooler areas on the sun's surface as large as 50,000 miles (80,000 km) making them visible from Earth with the naked eye.
The sun is actually white, the Earth's atmosphere makes it appear yellow.
In around 5 billion years time the sun will become a red giant, destroying the planets Mercury, Venus and Earth in the process.
The atmosphere of the sun consists of several layers called the photosphere, chromosphere, transition region and corona.
