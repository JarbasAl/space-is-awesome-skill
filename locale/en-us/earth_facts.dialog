Earth is the third planet from the sun, orbiting at a distance of 150 million km.
It is the fifth biggest planet in the solar system with a diameter of 13,000 km.
Earth is around 4.5 billion years old.
The Earth spins on its own axis every 23 hours 56 minutes and takes 365 days 6 hours to orbit the sun.
The inner core of the Earth creates a magnetic field around the planet which protects it from solar winds, the liquid metal core is believed to be hotter than the surface of the sun.
Life first appeared on the planet 3.5 billion years ago in the form of single celled organisms.
Modern humans have only existed on the planet for around 200,000 years.
The Earth is less well mapped than the Moon, Venus or Mars because the majority of its surface is covered by water.
The first picture of Earth taken from space occurred in October 1946.
