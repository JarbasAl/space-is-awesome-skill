The universe is around 13.7 billion years old.
It is thought the universe was born when a super dense object smaller than a sub atomic particle began to rapidly expand.
The first galaxies in the universe began to form around 13.2 billion years ago.
There are now over 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe.
Each galaxy contains billions of stars, our own Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 200 billion stars.
Only around 4% of the universe is composed of visible matter, the remaining 96% is composed of invisible dark matter and dark energy.
The shape of the universe is unknown, it may possibly be flat or spherical in shape.
A flat shape could produce an infinite universe whereas a closed spherical universe would be finite.
The universe will not last forever, like everything that exists it has a lifespan.
The universe may not be unique, it could be one of many in a finite or even infinite multiverse system.
