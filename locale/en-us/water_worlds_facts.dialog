Water Worlds are planets whose surfaces are entirely covered in water.
Evidence suggests that these planets originally formed as objects made of ice and rock far from their parent star.
As they drifted towards the star they heated up melting the ice and so became covered in oceans.
Under the surface the water is so dense its consistency is more like ice.
