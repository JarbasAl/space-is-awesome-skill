Hot Jupiters are gas giant planets similar in mass to Jupiter but which orbit very close to their parent star.
As a result of the close proximity to their star their surface temperatures exceed 700C (1300F).
It seems that Hot Jupiters are very common in our galaxy, which is not what astronomers expected as gas giants orbit in cold regions of our solar system.
