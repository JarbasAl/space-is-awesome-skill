If the remaining core of an exploded star has a mass more than five times that of the sun they do not form into Neutron Stars, the force of collapse is just too great and nothing can stop gravity crushing the core into an object of infinite density and zero volume, these are known as Black Holes.
The gravitational force of a Black Hole is so strong that not even light can escape from it.
The point of no return for any object that strays too close to a Black Hole is called the Event Horizon, past this point any object will be pulled inside and ripped apart.
