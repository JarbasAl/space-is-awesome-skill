If the remaining core of an exploded star has a mass more than five times that of the sun they do not form into Neutron Stars, the force of collapse is just too great and nothing can stop gravity crushing the core into an object of infinite density and zero volume, these are known as Black Holes.
The gravitational force of a Black Hole is so strong that not even light can escape from it.
The massive gravitational influence of a black hole distorts space and time in the near neighbourhood. The closer you get to a black hole, the slower time runs. Material that gets too close to a black hole gets sucked in and can never escape.
Material spirals in to a black hole through an accretion disk — a disk of gas, dust, stars and planets that fall into orbit the black hole.
The “point of no return” around a black hole is called the “event horizon”. This is the region where the gravity of the black hole overcomes the momentum of material spinning around it in the accretion disk. Once something crosses the event horizon, it is lost to the pull of the black hole.
Black holes were first proposed to exist in the 18th century, but remained a mathematical curiosity until the first candidate black hole was found in 1964. It was called Cygnus X-1, an x-ray source in the constellation Cygnus.
Black holes do not emit radiation on their own. They are detected by the radiation given off as material is heated in the accretion disk, and also by the black hole’s gravitational effect on other nearby objects (or light passing by).
The point of no return for any object that strays too close to a Black Hole is called the Event Horizon, past this point any object will be pulled inside and ripped apart.
