Neutron Stars spin incredibly quickly, they can make hundreds of rotations per second, combine this with their intense magnetic field and neutron stars sometimes produce a beam of light, theses types of Neutron Stars are called Pulsars.
The light of Pulsars is caused by charged particles streaming along the axis of the magnetic field
