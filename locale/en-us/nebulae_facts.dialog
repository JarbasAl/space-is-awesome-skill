Nebulae are clouds of gas and dust which form in interstellar space.
They range in size from millions of miles across to hundreds of light years across.
Nebulas are mostly composed of hydrogen along with smaller amounts of other gases and dust particles.
Stars and planetary systems are formed from the gas and dust within nebulae.
The Orion Nebula is the closest star forming region to Earth, it lies 1,300 light years away and is thought to be around 25 light years across.
Nebulae which exist outside the Milky Way are known as extra-galactic nebulae.
Up until the 1920's distant galaxies were classified as nebulae.
Some nebulae can be seen in the night sky with the naked eye.
In 5 billion years our Sun will become a planetary nebula.
The word nebula is derived from the Latin word for cloud, the plural of nebula is nebulae, although nebulas is also used.
